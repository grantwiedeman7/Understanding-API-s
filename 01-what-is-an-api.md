# What Is an API?

APIs — **Application Programming Interfaces** — are tools that allow different software systems to communicate with each other. You use APIs every day without noticing:

- Weather apps use APIs to request weather data  
- Google Maps apps use APIs to send your location  
- Online stores use APIs to check product prices and inventory  

In simple terms:

> **An API lets one program ask another program for information or perform an action.**

## Real-Life Analogy

Think of an API like a waiter in a restaurant:

- You (the user/program) tell the waiter what you want  
- The waiter (the API) sends your request to the kitchen (the server)  
- The kitchen returns the food  
- The waiter delivers it back to you  

You never go into the kitchen.  
The API handles the communication for you.

## Why APIs Matter

APIs allow:

- Apps to share information  
- Websites to load dynamic data  
- Companies to build features faster  
- Systems to connect without exposing their internal code  

Without APIs, most modern apps simply wouldn’t function.
